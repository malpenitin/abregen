<p class="lead">

Flightless I (Flii) is a novel drug target that regulates important cellular behaviours including mobility, contraction, adhesion, proliferation and cytokine production. The activity of Flii is mediated through interaction with components of the cell’s cytoskeleton, modulation of intracellular signalling pathways and regulation of cellular transcription events.

	A significant body of research has shown that Flii is a negative regulator of the migratory and proliferative events of tissue repair [see publications from the Cowin laboratory below]. For example, using transgenic models, it has been demonstrated that Flii ‘over-expressing’ mice exhibit larger, less contracted, wounds, reduced cellular proliferation and delayed reepithelialisation. Conversely, Flii-deficient mice show improved epidermal migration and re-epithelialisation, and enhanced wound vascularisation.

<p class="lead">
Importantly, neutralising antibodies to Flightless I have been shown to improve wound repair in murine and porcine models of normal and compromised would healing<sup>11, 17</sup>, and a murine model of epidermolysis bullosa<sup>15</sup>.

<h3>Treatment of early stage blisters with neutralising antibodies to Flightless I improves healing in a mouse model of epidermolysis bullosa</h3>

<p class="lead">

Anti-flightless antibodies or IgG dose-matched control antibodies formulated in a cream vehicle were applied onto the skin of EB mice for three consecutive days at the start of blister formation (Days 8-10). EB mice treated with anti-flightless antibodies were observed to have significantly fewer blisters and reduced number of lesions compared with EB mice treated with control IgG antibody.

Anti-flightless antibodies or IgG dose-matched control antibodies were administered every two weeks (weeks, 0, 2, 4, 8) to primary squamous cell carcinomas induced on the back of Balb/c mice. Mice treated with anti-Flightless I had significantly decreased tumour volume from week 4.
